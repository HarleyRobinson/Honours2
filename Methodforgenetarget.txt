Method for gene target selection: 
Pick target genes: so choose miR to investigate (363, 574, 20b, 220? etc). find predicted genes, compare with 
expressed genes for all cavin(or respective if doing that). Perform gene Ontology on these. Take top genes that are 
differentially expressed and look at their function. if interesting, keep as target.
