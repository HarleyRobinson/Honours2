AB  - A subset of breast cancer cells displays increased ability to self-renew and reproduce breast cancer heterogeneity. The characterization of these so-called putative breast tumor-initiating cells (BT-ICs) may open the road for novel therapeutic strategies. As microRNAs (miRNAs) control developmental programs in stem cells, BT-ICs may also rely on specific miRNA profiles for their sustained activity. To explore the notion that miRNAs may have a role in sustaining BT-ICs, we performed a comprehensive profiling of miRNA expression in a model of putative BT-ICs enriched by non-attachment growth conditions.
