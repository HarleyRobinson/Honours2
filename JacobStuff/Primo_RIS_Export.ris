N2  - Â  Or, "Who are the people who don't like Jewish people?" Or, "How come Black people were slaves?" Or, "Why does my mom have to be in Afghanistan?" Teachers wonder what approaches to take to talk with children about issues like ecological dangers, intolerance, racism, and war. [...]in the well-known allegory, The Lorax (Seuss, 1971), the fate of the Truffula trees at the hands of the Once-ler's needs to create and sell Thneeds is allegorical to the wasteful use of natural resources in the service of unrestrained commercial interests. In allegory, although setting, characters, and action are explicit, the values assigned to those elements are constructed individually by the reader/listener (Hamilton, 2011).
