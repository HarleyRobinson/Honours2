Note on Pull down data: western, anti rabbit, IP
Ladder, L, Blank, WCL, [mext 4 are without crosslink], 148acontrol, 148a result, IP control, IPresults. Now the next few im unsure. 
according to my notes its, 148a sample, IP control, IP result and then 148a result. But that cant be true becuase the positive result is currently
the lane that should be blank (IP control)
