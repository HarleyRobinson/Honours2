P4HB	9606.ENSP00000327801	prolyl 4-hydroxylase, beta polypeptide; This multifunctional protein catalyzes the formation, breakage and rearrangement of disulfide bonds. At the cell surface, seems to act as a reductase that cleaves disulfide bonds of proteins attached to the cell. May therefore cause structural modifications of exofacial proteins. Inside the cell, seems to form/rearrange disulfide bonds of nascent proteins. At high concentrations, functions as a chaperone that inhibits aggregation of misfolded proteins. At low concentrations, facilitates aggregation (anti-chaperone activity). May be involved with  [...]

SUGT1	9606.ENSP00000367208	SGT1, suppressor of G2 allele of SKP1 (S. cerevisiae); May play a role in ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation of target proteins
ATF6	9606.ENSP00000356919	activating transcription factor 6; Transcription factor that acts during endoplasmic reticulum stress by activating unfolded protein response target genes. Binds DNA on the 5'-CCAC[GA]-3'half of the ER stress response element (ERSE) (5'-CCAAT-N(9)-CCAC[GA]-3') and of ERSE II (5'-ATTGG-N-CCACG-3'). Binding to ERSE requires binding of NF-Y to ERSE. Could also be involved in activation of transcription by the serum response factor
TLR4	9606.ENSP00000363089	toll-like receptor 4
AHSA1	9606.ENSP00000216479	AHA1, activator of heat shock 90kDa protein ATPase homolog 1 (yeast); Cochaperone that stimulates HSP90 ATPase activity (By similarity). May affect a step in the endoplasmic reticulum to Golgi trafficking
HYOU1	9606.ENSP00000384144	hypoxia up-regulated 1; Has a pivotal role in cytoprotective cellular mechanisms triggered by oxygen deprivation. May play a role as a molecular chaperone and participate in protein folding
CALR	9606.ENSP00000320866	calreticulin; Calcium-binding chaperone that promotes folding, oligomeric assembly and quality control in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) via the calreticulin/calnexin cycle. This lectin interacts transiently with almost all of the monoglucosylated glycoproteins that are synthesized in the ER. Interacts with the DNA-binding domain of NR3C1 and mediates its nuclear export. Involved in maternal gene expression regulation. May participate in oocyte maturation via the regulation of calcium homeostasis (By similarity)

LRP1	9606.ENSP00000243077	low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1; Endocytic receptor involved in endocytosis and in phagocytosis of apoptotic cells. Required for early embryonic development. Involved in cellular lipid homeostasis. Involved in the plasma clearance of chylomicron remnants and activated LRPAP1 (alpha 2-macroglobulin), as well as the local metabolism of complexes between plasminogen activators and their endogenous inhibitors. May modulate cellular events, such as APP metabolism, kinase-dependent intracellular signaling, neuronal calcium signaling as well as neurotransmission
DNAJB11	9606.ENSP00000265028	DnaJ (Hsp40) homolog, subfamily B, member 11; Serves as a co-chaperone for HSPA5. Binds directly to both unfolded proteins that are substrates for ERAD and nascent unfolded peptide chains, but dissociates from the HSPA5-unfolded protein complex before folding is completed.
